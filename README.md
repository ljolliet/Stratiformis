# e-commerceWebSite

Stratifromis is a e-commerce classical music website. We had to create different pages exposing the different composers, albums and song.We also had to create a page per item, a way to sort them, a basket and a connection page. We choose the ASPMVC framework to manage the whole project.
This project has used a private server database from IUT de Bordeaux.
